# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 12: Measuring What Matters

## Why This Chapter Matters
At the executive level, metrics aren’t just numbers — they are **commitments**.  
They define how success is judged, what gets attention, and what resources get allocated.  
The wrong metrics = the wrong behaviors.

---

## The Three Levels of Metrics
1. **North Star Metric (NSM)** — The single measure that best captures long-term value creation.  
   *Example*: Spotify’s “Time spent listening.”  
2. **KPI Trees** — Break down NSM into supporting metrics for each department.  
3. **Operational Metrics** — The daily/weekly indicators that drive action at the front lines.

---

## Characteristics of Good Metrics
- **Aligned** — Tied directly to strategy.
- **Actionable** — A clear owner can move it.
- **Comparable** — Trackable over time or against a benchmark.
- **Balanced** — Avoids creating perverse incentives by pairing with counter-metrics.

---

## The Metrics Stack
**Top layer** — Board & exec dashboard (NSM + top KPIs)  
**Middle layer** — Functional dashboards (marketing, product, ops)  
**Bottom layer** — Operational boards (team-specific, tactical metrics)

---

## Metric Design Principles
- **Lagging vs. leading** — Lagging tells you *what happened*, leading predicts *what will happen*.
- **Vanity vs. value** — Favor metrics that reflect outcomes, not appearances.
- **Perverse incentive check** — Every metric should have a paired counterbalance.  
  *Example*: Speed of feature releases ↔ % of releases without critical bugs.

## Unit Economics for Executives
Track the **profitability of the business model at the smallest meaningful unit**:
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- LTV (Lifetime Value)
- Contribution margin
- Payback period

When unit economics are strong, growth scales sustainably. When weak, growth scales losses.

---

## Dashboards That Drive Action
- **One-page view** — No more than 8–10 metrics per audience.
- **Owner names** — Every metric has a DRI.
- **Traffic-light status** — Green/Yellow/Red to signal focus areas.
- **Narrative context** — Metrics alone don’t explain *why*.

---

## Measurement Cadence
- **Weekly** — Operational reviews, short-term adjustments.
- **Monthly** — KPI reviews, resource reallocation.
- **Quarterly** — Strategic metric reviews, NSM validation.
- **Annually** — Metric reset based on strategy shifts.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Metric creep** — Tracking too many dilutes focus.
- **Gaming the numbers** — When incentives drive metric manipulation.
- **Blind spots** — Ignoring metrics for risk, quality, or employee health.
- **Static metrics** — Failing to evolve measures as the business changes.

3. **Counter-metric pairing (20m)** — Identify perverse incentive risks and add balances.
4. **Dashboard design (20m)** — Build or refine top-layer dashboards.
5. **Cadence lock (10m)** — Set review frequency and owners.
