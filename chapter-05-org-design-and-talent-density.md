# Chapter 05: Org Design & Talent Density

## Why This Chapter Matters
Most strategy failures aren’t *thinking* problems — they’re **org design** problems.  
If the wrong people are in the wrong structure, even the best strategy will crawl.

## What Goes Wrong Without This
- Structure drift: Org charts reflect history, not strategy; handoffs stall work.
- Managerial debt: Low talent density forces micromanagement and rework.
- Title inflation: Authority without capability undermines execution.
- Succession gaps: Single points of failure create fragility and slow promotions.

Your job:  
- Design the **minimum viable structure** that executes the strategy.  
- Maintain **high talent density** so every hire lifts the curve.

## First Principle: Structure Follows Strategy
Don’t design for “org chart beauty” — design for the work that must be done. Ask: What are the critical capabilities we must excel at? What’s the smallest structure that delivers them? How will decisions flow between these capabilities?

## Spans & Layers — The Goldilocks Zone
Span of control refers to the number of direct reports a leader can effectively manage — too wide leads to no coaching and shallow management, while too narrow creates bureaucracy and slow decisions. Keep layers as few as possible to avoid communication decay.

**Rule of thumb**: In early stages, use wide spans (7–10 DRs) with few layers; in growth stages, moderate spans (5–7 DRs), adding layers only when complexity demands.

---

## Talent Density — Raising the Average
- **Talent density** = proportion of high performers in your org.
- High density means faster decisions, less politics, higher bar for everyone.
- Low density creates **managerial debt**: constant hand-holding, rework, missed targets.

**Maintaining density**:
- Hire slow, fire fast (for values/impact mismatch).
- Use performance data, not sentiment, to guide moves.
- Treat recruiting as a **core exec function**, not HR’s job alone.

## The 9-Box Talent Grid
A tool for plotting performance vs. potential:
- **Stars**: High performance, high potential — promote, stretch.
- **Workhorses**: High performance, low potential — keep in role, reward.
- **Question Marks**: Low performance, high potential — coach, decide quickly.
- **Laggards**: Low performance, low potential — exit quickly.

---

## Succession Planning as a Living Process
- Always have **ready-now** and **ready-soon** candidates for critical roles.
- Make it visible to the exec team — avoid “talent surprises” when someone leaves.
- Build internal talent pipelines alongside external recruiting.

---

## Common Org Design Patterns
- **Functional** — Good for specialization, weaker cross-functional alignment.
- **Divisional** — Good for product lines or geographies, risk of silos.
- **Matrix** — Combines both, but high complexity; only for mature orgs.
- **Pod/Squad** — Cross-functional mini-business units; agile but can duplicate effort.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
Avoid these common org design mistakes:
- **Title inflation** — Creates fragile orgs when “leaders” aren’t actually leading.
- **Reshuffle addiction** — Changing the org chart instead of fixing execution.
- **Over-hiring leaders** — Too many chiefs, not enough operators.
- **Ignoring the B-players** — They define culture as much as A-players.

## 90-Minute Org & Talent Workshop
1. **Strategy alignment (20m)** — Identify the critical capabilities from your strategy.
2. **Org mapping (20m)** — Design structure to deliver those capabilities.
3. **Talent audit (20m)** — Plot your top 50 roles on the 9-box grid.
4. **Succession gaps (15m)** — Mark roles with no ready-now/soon replacements.
5. **Action plan (15m)** — Hiring, exits, role changes to close gaps.

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Keep structure minimal; prioritize A-player bar; founders hold DRIs.
- Scaleup: Add layers only when forced; codify career architecture; strengthen recruiting loop.
- Enterprise: Clarify decision rights in matrix; invest in manager capability.
- Regulated: Segregation of duties; compliance roles defined; documented competencies.
- Remote/Distributed: Smaller spans; explicit rituals; strong written interfaces.

## Mini‑Case: Density Over Headcount
Two comparable teams had very different outcomes. The smaller, high-density team shipped faster and cleaner. By exiting 2 low performers and hiring 1 star, the org increased throughput 30% with fewer heads and less managerial debt.
