## Practical Example

### Context
We need to boost lead gen for our SaaS platform. Current pipeline is 20% below target. This is a Type 2 (reversible) decision.

### Options Considered
1. **Internal Campaign**: Build in-house (Cost: $50K, Time: 2 months).
2. **Agency Partner**: Outsource to proven agency (Cost: $80K, Time: 1 month).
3. **No Campaign**: Reliance on organic growth (Cost: $0, Risk: Miss revenue targets).

### Recommendation
Option 2: Agency Partner. Faster time to market with higher quality creatives.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Over-budget (Mitigation: Fixed-price contract).
- Risk: Misaligned messaging (Mitigation: Weekly reviews).

### Impact
- Customers: Better targeting, +15% leads.
- Financial: $80K cost, projected $300K revenue lift.
- Ops: Minimal internal load.

### Decision Rights (RAPID)
