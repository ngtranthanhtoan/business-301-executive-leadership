| Scalability & Control | 10% | 9 | 6 | 5 | Full control with build; limited with buy/partner. |
| Team Impact (Skills, Morale) | 10% | 7 | 5 | 6 | Build grows internal AI expertise; buy may require layoffs; partner maintains focus. |
| ROI Projection | 5% | 8 | 7 | 6 | Build: 3x ROI in 2 years; Buy: 2.5x; Partner: 2x. |
