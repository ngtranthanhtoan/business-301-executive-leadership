# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 10: Product & Platform Scaling

## Why This Chapter Matters
At some point, the bottleneck to growth isn’t market demand — it’s the company’s **ability to deliver at scale**.  
Scaling is about **adding capacity and capability faster than complexity increases**.

---

## The Three Scaling Dimensions
1. **Product scaling** — Expanding product reach, features, and markets.
2. **Platform scaling** — Increasing technical capacity, reliability, and interoperability.
3. **Organizational scaling** — Growing teams, processes, and decision-making without slowing down.

---

## Product Scaling Principles
- **Win in one beachhead before expanding** — Nail a niche before chasing adjacencies.
- **Add features with discipline** — Tie every new capability to revenue, retention, or moat.
- **Balance new vs. core** — Avoid starving the proven product while chasing shiny new bets.
- **Internationalization readiness** — Build for multiple languages, currencies, and regulations early if global is in your roadmap.

---

## Platform Scaling Principles
- **Reliability before speed** — Downtime kills trust faster than slow feature velocity.
- **Technical debt is capital** — Manage it deliberately; pay it down when the interest is high.
- **APIs and modularity** — Design systems to evolve independently.
- **Observability as a scaling lever** — Logging, tracing, and metrics let you grow without losing control.

---

## Organizational Scaling Principles
- **Autonomous teams** — Create squads/pods with clear goals and metrics.
- **Shared services** — Centralize capabilities like data, infra, and security to reduce duplication.
- **Scaling rituals** — Quarterly strategy reviews, cross-team demos, and incident reviews.
- **Hire ahead of need** — Especially in leadership roles where ramp time is long.

---

## Build/Buy/Partner Decisions
- **Build** when it’s core to your moat or competitive advantage.
- **Buy** when speed matters more than uniqueness.
- **Partner** when scale or network effects are better achieved with allies.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Scaling chaos** — Growing headcount faster than clarity.
- **Over-optimizing too early** — Adding heavy process before product-market fit is solid.
- **Ignoring platform limits** — Latency, cost, and compliance can become silent killers.
- **“Big bang” rewrites** — They stall progress; favor incremental modernization.

## 90-Minute Product & Platform Scaling Workshop
1. **Bottleneck mapping (20m)** — Identify current constraints in product, platform, and org.
2. **Impact mapping (20m)** — Link each bottleneck to business impact.
3. **Prioritization (20m)** — Rank scaling initiatives by ROI and urgency.
4. **Build/Buy/Partner (20m)** — Decide the right approach for top 3 initiatives.
5. **Metrics & owners (10m)** — Assign success metrics and DRIs.
