# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 6: Decision Architecture

## Why This Chapter Matters
As an executive, you’re less valuable as a **decision maker** and more valuable as a **decision architect** — designing **how** and **where** decisions get made so the organization can act fast without chaos.

## Three Truths About Decisions at Scale
1. **Unclear ownership** is the #1 cause of slow or bad decisions.  
2. **Speed matters** — but only if you protect quality.  
3. **Process beats heroics** — consistent frameworks outperform ad-hoc “saves.”

## The Two Door Model (Jeff Bezos)
- **Type 1 (One-Way Door)** — Hard to reverse, high stakes, needs deliberate process.  
  *Example*: Entering a new market, acquiring a company.
- **Type 2 (Two-Way Door)** — Reversible, low stakes, bias for speed.  
  *Example*: Changing a marketing tagline, adjusting a UI color.

**Rule**: Push Type 2 decisions as far down the org as possible.

## Decision Frameworks That Scale
- **RAPID** (Bain)  
  - **R**ecommend: Writes the brief, proposes.  
  - **A**gree: Has veto power on certain aspects.  
  - **P**erform: Executes after decision.  
  - **I**nput: Consulted before decision.  
  - **D**ecide: The final call.

- **DARCI** (nonprofit sector)  
  - **D**river: Ensures work happens.  
  - **A**pprover: Signs off.  
  - **R**esponsible: Does the work.  
  - **C**onsulted: Gives advice.  
  - **I**nformed: Gets updates.

## The Decision Brief (1–2 Pages)
**Purpose**: Avoids “decision by PowerPoint” and gives a reusable artifact.  
**Sections**:
1. **Context** — What’s the decision and why now?
2. **Options considered** — At least 2 real alternatives.
3. **Recommendation** — Chosen path, with rationale.
4. **Risks & mitigations** — What could go wrong, and countermeasures.
5. **Impact** — On customers, financials, ops, brand.
6. **Decision rights** — Who Decides, who Performs, who’s Informed.

## Decision Escalation Ladder
- **Level 1**: Individual/team decides within agreed boundaries.
- **Level 2**: Department head or functional leader decides.
- **Level 3**: Exec team or CEO decides (rare).

Escalation should be **explicit and fast** — no decision should wait in limbo.

---

## The Decision Audit
Quarterly, review:
- How many decisions were made at each level.
- Time from proposal to decision.
- % of decisions that hit desired outcome.
- Lessons from reversals or misses.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Consensus paralysis** — Not every decision needs everyone’s blessing.
- **Shadow decisions** — Outcomes decided informally without accountability.
- **Over-escalation** — Leaders pulled into Type 2 decisions that could be delegated.
- **No decision memory** — Repeating debates because no record exists.

## 90-Minute Decision Architecture Workshop
1. **Decision mapping (20m)** — List 10 recurring decisions; classify as Type 1 or 2.
2. **Assign rights (20m)** — Apply RAPID or DARCI to each.
3. **Draft briefs (20m)** — Pick 2 big upcoming decisions; write briefs.
4. **Design escalation (15m)** — Agree on triggers and turnaround SLAs.
5. **Set audit rhythm (15m)** — Quarterly review with metrics.
