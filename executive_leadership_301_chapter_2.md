# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 2: Strategy & Narrative

## Why This Chapter Matters
At the executive level, **strategy and narrative are inseparable**.  
A strategy without a compelling story will never be adopted.  
A story without a solid strategy will eventually collapse.

Your job:  
- Define **what game you’re playing**, **where you can win**, and **how you’ll win**.  
- Wrap that in a **narrative** that your teams, investors, and customers can retell without dilution.

## The Strategy Kernel (Richard Rumelt Model)
A usable strategy has three parts:
1. **Diagnosis** — The hard truth about the situation, framed simply.
2. **Guiding Policy** — The approach you’ll take (and the approaches you will not take).
3. **Coherent Actions** — Specific, coordinated moves that align with the guiding policy.

*Example*:  
- **Diagnosis**: Our churn is 3x industry average because onboarding is inconsistent and slow.  
- **Guiding Policy**: Be the easiest product in our category to adopt — no more than 15 minutes to value.  
- **Coherent Actions**: Redesign onboarding flow; double CS headcount; launch automated migration tools.

## The 3 Horizons Framework (To Balance Now vs Next)
- **Horizon 1**: Core business — defend and optimize.  
- **Horizon 2**: Emerging bets — grow into adjacent markets.  
- **Horizon 3**: Future options — experiments that may redefine the business.

You need **all three** — but most orgs over-invest in H1 and starve H2/H3.

## Narrative as an Executive Tool
A good narrative:
- Is **memorable** (easy to retell accurately).
- Is **anchored in truth** (rooted in your diagnosis).
- Contains **stakes** (why it matters now).
- Has a **clear protagonist** (the customer, the company, the product).
- Ends with a **call to action**.

**Test**: If a mid-level manager can’t retell your strategy in 60 seconds and inspire their team, your narrative isn’t working.

## The Executive’s Communication Stack
1. **North Star Statement** — The big “why”.
2. **3 Strategic Pillars** — The how.
3. **Proof Points** — Evidence you’re on track (metrics, wins, testimonials).
4. **Stories** — Customer examples, product demos, market shifts.
5. **Call to Action** — What you want the listener to do now.

## Crafting Your Strategy Narrative
**Template:**
```
Headline: <One sentence version of the strategy>

Diagnosis:
- What’s true about the market, competition, or us that creates urgency?

Guiding Policy:
- How we’re going to win (and what we won’t do).

3-5 Strategic Pillars:
1) Pillar name — why it matters — how it looks in action.
2) ...
3) ...

Coherent Actions:
- For each pillar, 1–3 tangible actions or projects.

Proof Points:
- Early wins or signals that the strategy works.

Call to Action:
- What every employee should start/stop/continue doing now.
```

## Embedding Strategy in the Organization
- Use **repetition without boredom** — same story, different angles, in every forum.
- Make strategy **visible** — posters, dashboards, product roadmaps.
- Build **storytellers** — equip your VPs, Directors, and Managers to tell the same story in their own words.
- Tie **compensation and recognition** to actions that advance the strategy.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Buzzword salad** — If you can swap your company name for another’s and it still reads fine, it’s not specific enough.
- **One-and-done strategy decks** — Strategy is a living document, not an annual slide ritual.
- **Assuming comprehension** — Test understanding regularly; the gap between what you said and what people heard is wide.
- **Overcomplication** — If you can’t explain it to a new hire in week one, it won’t scale.

## 90-Minute Strategy & Narrative Workshop
1. **Diagnosis Drill (20m)** — Write your market/company truth in 1–2 sentences.
2. **Pillar Sprint (20m)** — Draft 3–5 strategic pillars; assign one owner each.
3. **Action Mapping (20m)** — Link coherent actions to each pillar.
4. **Narrative Draft (20m)** — Fill in the template above.
5. **Story Rehearsal (10m)** — Deliver to a peer; refine until they can retell it.
6. **Distribution Plan (10m)** — Decide how and where the story will be told in the next 30 days.

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Sharpen diagnosis; single bold pillar; 30-day proof points.
- Scaleup: Three pillars; measurable bets; monthly narrative refresh.
- Enterprise: Business-unit alignment; board-ready narrative; avoid buzzwords.
- Regulated: Explicit risk posture; compliance woven into pillars.
- Remote/Distributed: Written first; leader scripts; async distribution.

## Mini‑Case: Strategy People Can Retell
A company’s strategy deck wasn’t adopted. They rewrote it to a one-sentence headline, three pillars, and five stories. Manager retell scores hit 90%, and execution velocity increased as teams aligned on the narrative.
