# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 9: Culture by Design

## Why This Chapter Matters
Culture isn’t just “how we do things around here.”  
It’s the **default operating system** of the company — the unwritten rules that guide decisions when no one is watching.  
At the executive level, your job is to **design**, **model**, and **reinforce** the culture you want.

---

## The Culture Equation
```
Culture = Values (what we believe) 
        + Norms (how we behave) 
        + Systems (what we reward & punish)
```
If any element is missing, culture drifts toward convenience, not excellence.

### Culture → Product → Culture — Visual

## Culture → Product → Culture Loop
Culture shapes how products are built, which in turn shapes customer experience, and customer expectations feed back into internal behaviors. For example, Amazon’s obsession with speed and low prices reinforced customer expectations, pushing internal teams to maintain operational excellence.

---

## Defining Culture Intentionally
Define culture with 4–6 clear, specific, non-generic values; map each value to visible actions and anti-patterns; include real examples of values in action through stories; establish regular practices that reinforce values via rituals; and use visual cues, language, and traditions as symbols that signal what matters.

---

## Operationalizing Culture
- **Hiring** — Screen for values alignment as hard as for skills.
- **Onboarding** — Teach values with stories and case studies.
- **Performance reviews** — Measure *how* results are achieved, not just *what* is achieved.
- **Recognition programs** — Publicly reward behaviors that match the desired culture.
- **Exit process** — Offboard in a way that reinforces dignity and values.

---

## Cultural Maintenance
- **Leader modeling** — Executives must live the values visibly.
- **Pulse surveys** — Quick, frequent temperature checks on culture health.
- **Cultural onboarding for leaders** — Ensure new execs align before they change norms.
- **Pruning** — Actively remove behaviors, policies, and people that violate core values.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
Watch for:
- **Poster values** — Values written on walls but ignored in practice.
- **Value sprawl** — Too many “values” dilute focus.
- **Tolerating culture violations for high performers** — This erodes trust faster than anything.
- **Culture ossification** — Refusing to evolve values as the business changes.

---

## 90-Minute Culture by Design Workshop
1. **Value definition (20m)** — Review and refine the core 4–6 values.
2. **Behavior mapping (20m)** — For each value, list visible behaviors and anti-patterns.
3. **Ritual audit (20m)** — List existing rituals; prune or add to reinforce values.
4. **Story collection (20m)** — Gather 3–5 true stories that illustrate each value.
5. **Symbol check (10m)** — Ensure visual cues and language match desired culture.

---

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Few values; high clarity on anti-patterns; leadership modeling daily.
- Scaleup: Codify rituals; embed in hiring and onboarding; prune misaligned practices.
- Enterprise: Refresh values with strategy; avoid ossification; guard against politics.
- Regulated: Emphasize integrity, transparency; align incentives with compliance.
- Remote/Distributed: Written norms; explicit rituals; async recognition.

## Mini‑Case: Rituals Over Posters
An org with “innovation” posters still punished risk. By adding monthly “failed experiment” demos and rewarding learnings, they unlocked bolder product bets and higher engagement.
