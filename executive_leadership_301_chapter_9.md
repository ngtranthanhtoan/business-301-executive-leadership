# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 9: Culture by Design

## Why This Chapter Matters
Culture isn’t just “how we do things around here.”  
It’s the **default operating system** of the company — the unwritten rules that guide decisions when no one is watching.  
At the executive level, your job is to **design**, **model**, and **reinforce** the culture you want.

## The Culture Equation
```
Culture = Values (what we believe) 
        + Norms (how we behave) 
        + Systems (what we reward & punish)
```
If any element is missing, culture drifts toward convenience, not excellence.

---

## Culture → Product → Culture Loop
- Culture shapes **how products are built**.
- Products shape **customer experience**.
- Customer expectations feed back into **internal behaviors**.

Example:  
Amazon’s obsession with speed and low prices reinforced customer expectations, which in turn pushed internal teams to maintain operational excellence.

---

## Defining Culture Intentionally
1. **Values** — 4–6 clear, specific, non-generic beliefs.
2. **Behaviors** — Each value mapped to visible actions and anti-patterns.
3. **Stories** — Real examples of the values in action.
4. **Rituals** — Regular practices that reinforce values.
5. **Symbols** — Visual cues, language, and traditions that signal what matters.

---

## Operationalizing Culture
- **Hiring** — Screen for values alignment as hard as for skills.
- **Onboarding** — Teach values with stories and case studies.
- **Performance reviews** — Measure *how* results are achieved, not just *what* is achieved.
- **Recognition programs** — Publicly reward behaviors that match the desired culture.
- **Exit process** — Offboard in a way that reinforces dignity and values.

---

## Cultural Maintenance
- **Leader modeling** — Executives must live the values visibly.
- **Pulse surveys** — Quick, frequent temperature checks on culture health.
- **Cultural onboarding for leaders** — Ensure new execs align before they change norms.
- **Pruning** — Actively remove behaviors, policies, and people that violate core values.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Poster values** — Values written on walls but ignored in practice.
- **Value sprawl** — Too many “values” dilute focus.
- **Tolerating culture violations for high performers** — This erodes trust faster than anything.
- **Culture ossification** — Refusing to evolve values as the business changes.

## 90-Minute Culture by Design Workshop
1. **Value definition (20m)** — Review and refine the core 4–6 values.
2. **Behavior mapping (20m)** — For each value, list visible behaviors and anti-patterns.
3. **Ritual audit (20m)** — List existing rituals; prune or add to reinforce values.
4. **Story collection (20m)** — Gather 3–5 true stories that illustrate each value.
5. **Symbol check (10m)** — Ensure visual cues and language match desired culture.
