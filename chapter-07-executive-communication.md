# Chapter 07: Executive Communication

## Why This Chapter Matters
At the executive level, communication is not “sharing information” — it’s **shaping perception and driving action**.  
Every word you say (or don’t say) has multiplied effects across teams, investors, customers, and media.

## What Goes Wrong Without This
- Message fragmentation: Different teams hear different priorities; execution diverges.
- Surprise escalations: Boards and bosses lose trust when asks are buried.
- Info overload: Too many words, not enough signal; audiences tune out.
- Crisis missteps: Inconsistent internal/external messaging amplifies damage.

## The Three Directions of Executive Communication
Executive communication flows in three directions: upward to the board, investors, and CEO for clarity and no surprises; downward to teams for alignment, context, and inspiration; and outward to customers, partners, and media for trust and authority.

---

## The Core Executive Communication Rules
Follow these core rules: be the signal, not the noise by removing fluff and highlighting what matters; provide context first, detail second so execs and managers know the why before the what; write to think, as clear writing leads to clear speaking; and ensure no surprises by delivering bad news early with options ready.

## The Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)
A simple way to structure any communication:
1. Start with the **answer or recommendation**.
2. Group supporting arguments in 3–4 points.
3. Back each point with data, examples, or stories.

**Example**:  
**Top line**: “We should pause the product launch for 3 weeks.”  
- Reason 1: Customer testing shows 35% churn in first week.  
- Reason 2: Two major bugs in payment flow.  
- Reason 3: Key partner will be ready in 3 weeks, improving launch reach.

## Communication Formats That Work at Exec Level
- **One-pagers** — For decisions, updates, and proposals.
- **Memos** — For deep, complex issues (5–7 pages max).
- **Dashboards** — For recurring operational updates.
- **Story-led presentations** — For external pitches or all-hands.

---

## Downward Communication: Aligning the Organization
- Always **connect work to strategy**.
- Repeat key messages until *you’re bored* — that’s when people start hearing them.
- Use **stories** to make the abstract concrete.
- Make **call to action** explicit in every communication.

---

## Upward Communication: Managing Your Boss/Board
- Lead with **what’s changed** since the last update.
- Flag **decisions needed** — don’t bury asks in status updates.
- Provide **options with pros/cons** — not just problems.
- Be transparent about risks — credibility compounds over time.

---

## Outward Communication: Protecting and Amplifying the Brand
- Speak from **values and strategy**, not from defensive reaction.
- Pre-plan **message frameworks** for likely crisis scenarios.
- Build relationships with key partners and press **before** you need them.
- Treat every public statement as permanent — because it is.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
Steer clear of:
- **Overcommunicating everything** — Causes fatigue and dilution of key points.
- **Undercommunicating change** — Leaves room for rumors and fear.
- **Inconsistent tone** — Erodes trust between what’s said internally and externally.
- **Information hoarding** — Slows decision-making and fosters politics.

## 90-Minute Executive Communication Workshop
1. **Message audit (20m)** — Collect your last 5 major communications; assess clarity and alignment.
2. **Pyramid rewrite (20m)** — Restructure 2 recent updates using the Pyramid Principle.
3. **Story crafting (20m)** — Build 2 short customer or product stories linked to strategy.
4. **Upward brief (15m)** — Draft a one-pager for your board/CEO on a live decision.
5. **Crisis scenario (15m)** — Outline a holding statement and 3 key messages.

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Short, fast cycles; weekly all-hands; simple dashboards.
- Scaleup: Formalize one-pagers; install cadence for all-hands and board updates.
- Enterprise: Align BU narratives; ensure internal/external consistency.
- Regulated: Pre-approve risk language; align with Legal/Compliance.
- Remote/Distributed: Written-first; async video; leader scripts.

## Mini‑Case: “No Surprises” Culture
A company had board friction due to late bad news. Switching to “changes-and-asks first” one-pagers built trust; decisions sped up and board meetings shifted from surprises to choices.
