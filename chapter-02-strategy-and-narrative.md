# Chapter 02: Strategy & Narrative

## Why This Chapter Matters
At the executive level, strategy and narrative are inseparable. A strategy without a compelling story will never be adopted, while a story without a solid strategy will eventually collapse. Your job is to define what game you’re playing, where you can win, and how you’ll win, then wrap that in a narrative that your teams, investors, and customers can retell without dilution.

## What Goes Wrong Without This
- Decks without decisions: Strategy becomes an annual theater, not a living guide.
- Local optimizations: Teams pursue conflicting priorities, diluting impact.
- Story drift: Managers retell different versions; execution slows from confusion.
- Investor/customer skepticism: No crisp “why now” leads to hesitancy and higher friction.

## The Strategy Kernel (Richard Rumelt Model)
A usable strategy consists of three essential parts: a diagnosis that frames the hard truth about the situation simply; a guiding policy that outlines the approach you’ll take (and those you won’t); and coherent actions that are specific, coordinated moves aligning with the guiding policy.

*Example*:  
- **Diagnosis**: Our churn is 3x industry average because onboarding is inconsistent and slow.  
- **Guiding Policy**: Be the easiest product in our category to adopt — no more than 15 minutes to value.  
- **Coherent Actions**: Redesign onboarding flow; double CS headcount; launch automated migration tools.

## The 3 Horizons Framework (To Balance Now vs Next)
To balance immediate needs with future growth, use the 3 Horizons Framework:
- **Horizon 1**: Focus on the core business to defend and optimize it.  
- **Horizon 2**: Invest in emerging bets to grow into adjacent markets.  
- **Horizon 3**: Explore future options through experiments that may redefine the business.

You need all three horizons, but most organizations over-invest in Horizon 1 and starve Horizons 2 and 3.

## Narrative as an Executive Tool
A good narrative:
- Is **memorable** (easy to retell accurately).
- Is **anchored in truth** (rooted in your diagnosis).
- Contains **stakes** (why it matters now).
- Has a **clear protagonist** (the customer, the company, the product).
- Ends with a **call to action**.

**Test**: If a mid-level manager can’t retell your strategy in 60 seconds and inspire their team, your narrative isn’t working.

## The Executive’s Communication Stack
1. **North Star Statement** — The big “why”.
2. **3 Strategic Pillars** — The how.
3. **Proof Points** — Evidence you’re on track (metrics, wins, testimonials).
4. **Stories** — Customer examples, product demos, market shifts.
5. **Call to Action** — What you want the listener to do now.

## Crafting Your Strategy Narrative

See [Strategy Narrative Template](./templates/strategy_narrative.md)

## Embedding Strategy in the Organization
- Use **repetition without boredom** — same story, different angles, in every forum.
- Make strategy **visible** — posters, dashboards, product roadmaps.
- Build **storytellers** — equip your VPs, Directors, and Managers to tell the same story in their own words.
- Tie **compensation and recognition** to actions that advance the strategy.

## Pitfalls to Avoid
When developing strategy and narrative, steer clear of these common pitfalls:
- **Buzzword salad** — If you can swap your company name for another’s and it still reads fine, it’s not specific enough.
- **One-and-done strategy decks** — Strategy is a living document, not an annual slide ritual.
- **Assuming comprehension** — Test understanding regularly; the gap between what you said and what people heard is wide.
- **Overcomplication** — If you can’t explain it to a new hire in week one, it won’t scale.

## 90-Minute Strategy & Narrative Workshop
1. **Diagnosis Drill (20m)** — Write your market/company truth in 1–2 sentences.
2. **Pillar Sprint (20m)** — Draft 3–5 strategic pillars; assign one owner each.
3. **Action Mapping (20m)** — Link coherent actions to each pillar.
4. **Narrative Draft (20m)** — Fill in the template above.
5. **Story Rehearsal (10m)** — Deliver to a peer; refine until they can retell it.
6. **Distribution Plan (10m)** — Decide how and where the story will be told in the next 30 days.

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Sharpen diagnosis; single bold pillar; 30-day proof points.
- Scaleup: Three pillars; measurable bets; monthly narrative refresh.
- Enterprise: Business-unit alignment; board-ready narrative; avoid buzzwords.
- Regulated: Explicit risk posture; compliance woven into pillars.
- Remote/Distributed: Written first; leader scripts; async distribution.

## Mini‑Case: Strategy People Can Retell
A company’s strategy deck wasn’t adopted. They rewrote it to a one-sentence headline, three pillars, and five stories. Manager retell scores hit 90%, and execution velocity increased as teams aligned on the narrative.
