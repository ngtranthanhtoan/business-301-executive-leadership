# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 1: The Executive Shift

## What Changes at 301
At this level, your role shifts from being the person who solves hard problems to being the person who **shapes the conditions** in which the entire enterprise solves problems.  
Your core responsibilities become:
- **Allocate attention** — the rarest and most valuable resource.
- **Set context** so decisions can be made without you in the room.
- **Select people and design systems** that endure beyond individual projects.
- **Steward capital** — not just money, but also time, brand, and technical leverage.

## Five Executive Levers
1. **People** — Who gets the hardest problems; who is coached, promoted, or replaced.
2. **Strategy** — The few decisive bets, and what you explicitly will not do.
3. **Narrative** — A coherent story that aligns thousands of micro‑decisions.
4. **Systems** — Cadence, metrics, and clear decision rights.
5. **Capital** — Budgets, headcount, time, technical debt, and reputation.

## The Time Portfolio (Default)
- **60% Enterprise‑shaping**: strategy, market/customer insight, capital allocation, top‑talent moves.
- **30% Operating rhythm**: WBR/MBR, unblockers, cross‑functional coordination.
- **10% Maker/learning**: deep dives, strategic thinking, writing to clarify thought.

*Tip*: In early‑stage or turnaround situations, you may invert the 60/30 split—just make the choice deliberately.

## The Four Rooms (Mental Model)
- **Map Room** — Strategy and narrative (future focus).
- **Machine Room** — Operating system, numbers, performance (present focus).
- **Situation Room** — Acute response: incidents, PR, outages, crises.
- **Mirror Room** — Reflection: self‑inspection, ethics, energy management.

Healthy executives **schedule** time in each room weekly.

## Decision Rights That Scale You
- Define **one‑way vs. two‑way doors** and who decides each.
- Use a **RAPID/DARCI** framework so “consult vs. decide” is explicit.
- Establish **kill criteria** for projects at the moment they are approved.

## Core Rituals to Install
- **Weekly Business Review (WBR)** — 60–90 mins, same data cuts, same owners.
- **Monthly Business Review (MBR)** — Bet reviews, portfolio adjustments, risk review.
- **Quarterly Strategy Review** — Test thesis, markets, and moat; prune roadmap.
- **Talent Friday** (bi‑weekly) — Succession planning, recruiting pipeline, top talent focus.

## Deliverables (This Week)
1. **1‑Page Executive Charter** — Your scope, bets, and 90‑day outcomes.
2. **Decision Rights Map** — What you decide vs. delegate.
3. **Operating Cadence** — Your calendar becomes the company’s heartbeat.

### Executive Charter Template
```
Title: Exec Charter – <Your Name / Role> – <Quarter/Year>

Mission (1-2 sentences):
- Why this role exists for the enterprise, not just the org chart.

Strategic Constraints (2-3):
- Non-negotiables (e.g., “Profitable growth; no net-new infra unless it reduces unit cost in 2 quarters”).

Priorities (3-5):
1) <Priority> — Outcome by <Date> — Leading indicators:
2) <Priority> — Outcome by <Date> — Leading indicators:
3) ...

Non-Goals (2-4):
- Explicit de-prioritizations to protect focus.

Bets & Kill Criteria:
- Bet: <Name>. We stop if <metric/threshold/date>.

Decision Rights (Top 5):
- I decide: <areas>. I delegate: <areas> (to <who>) with review every <cadence>.

Stakeholders & Forums:
- Board/CEO/Peers: <forum + cadence>.
- Customers/Partners: <forum + cadence>.

Risks & Mitigations:
- <Risk> → <Mitigation/Trigger>
```

### Decision Rights Map Template (RAPID/DARCI hybrid)
```
Decision: <Name>
Context: <Why this matters; one-way or two-way door?>

D = Decider(s):
A = Accountable owner:
R = Recommenders (write the brief):
C = Consulted (must be heard before decision):
I = Informed (not in the room):

SLA & Escalation:
- Draft by <date>; decision by <date>. Escalate to <who> if blocked >48h.
```

### Operating Cadence Template (90 days)
```
Weekly:
- Mon: Exec staff (45m WBR + 30m blockers; docs read in advance)
- Tue: 1:1s (top talent, skip-levels)
- Wed: Strategy blocks (market/customer, product bets, partner calls)
- Thu: Capital/Talent (budget reviews, recruiting panels)
- Fri: Think/Write (memo day) + external comms

Monthly:
- MBR (bets, portfolio shifts, risk) — 2 hours, memo-led
- Board/Investor update — 1 page, leading indicators + variances

Quarterly:
- Strategy review — Retest thesis; start/stop/continue list
```

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Activity ≠ leverage** — A full calendar is often a symptom of weak systems.
- **New-bet bias** — Old bets compound; avoid starving what’s already working.
- **Silent drift** — Without a repeated story, teams invent their own.
- **Shadow decisions** — Unclear decision rights invite politics.

## 90‑Minute Workshop (Solo or with Staff)
1. **Calendar Audit (25m)** — Label the past two weeks as Map/Machine/Situation/Mirror. Rebalance.
2. **Charter Draft (35m)** — Fill in the 1‑pager; cut to 3–5 priorities.
3. **Decision Rights (20m)** — Identify 5 recurring decisions; assign RAPID roles.
4. **Cadence Commit (10m)** — Block the recurring forums on the calendar.
