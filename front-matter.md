## Who this book is for
- Executives and executive-trajectory leaders who own outcomes across multiple teams or functions.
- Founders, GMs, Chiefs of Staff, VPs, Directors preparing to operate at enterprise scale.

## How to use this book
- Each chapter follows the same pattern: Why it matters → frameworks → workshop → Ship It checklist.
- Start with Chapter 1 to install your executive “operating context,” then pick the chapter that addresses your immediate bottleneck.
- Produce the artifacts as you go. The book is designed to be shipped, not just read.

## Reading paths
- Rapid install (2 weeks): 1 → 3 → 6 → 2 → 4 → 12. Ship the core OS, decision rights, strategy, capital, and metrics.
- Scaling path (3–4 weeks): 1 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 8 → 9 → 11. Focus on scale, org design, governance, culture, and crisis readiness.
- Comprehensive path (6–8 weeks): Read in order, complete all workshops, and adopt the full template pack.

## What you will ship (artifact checklist)
- Executive Charter; Decision Rights Map; Decision Briefs; WBR/MBR agendas and dashboards; Board packet; Stakeholder map; Risk register; Culture doc; Succession plan; Crisis playbook; KPI tree; Dashboard spec.

## How the Chapters Connect (Throughlines)
- Strategy → OS → Metrics: Strategy sets direction; the OS makes it visible; metrics prove progress.
- Capital → Org → Culture: Where you fund shapes structure; structure and rituals shape culture.
- Decisions → Communication → Governance: Clear rights drive crisp messages and board confidence.
- Scaling → Crisis → Resilience: Platform strength and drills reduce incident blast radius and recovery time.
