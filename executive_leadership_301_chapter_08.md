# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 8: Governance & Stakeholders

## Why This Chapter Matters
At the executive level, you’re operating in a **network of obligations and influence**:  
- Internal governance: decision-making forums, policies, compliance.  
- External governance: boards, investors, regulators, major partners.  
- Stakeholder management: aligning powerful players without losing speed.

---

## The Four Pillars of Executive Governance
Executive governance rests on four pillars: clarity of authority, defining who can decide what at what risk threshold; transparency, ensuring the right people get the right information at the right time; accountability, where commitments are tracked, reviewed, and enforced; and adaptability, allowing governance to evolve as the company grows or shifts.

---

## Internal Governance: The “Minimum Viable Bureaucracy”
For internal governance, keep policies as guardrails, not handcuffs; use standing forums like WBR/MBR/Strategy Review as primary tools; maintain decision logs for informed reversals; and use exception handling instead of rewriting rules every time.

---

## External Governance: Board & Investor Management
- **Pre-wire decisions** — Have 1:1s with key board members before meetings to surface concerns.
- **Board packet discipline** — Clear agenda, concise metrics, explicit decisions needed.
- **No surprises** — Bad news shared early, with mitigation plan.
- **Follow-up rigor** — Track commitments from both sides.

---

## Stakeholder Mapping
A practical tool for managing influence and expectations:
1. **List key stakeholders** (internal & external).
2. **Score influence** (high/med/low) and alignment (ally/neutral/opposed).
3. **Plan engagement**:
   - **Allies** — Keep them close, give them wins to amplify.
   - **Neutrals** — Educate and show value.
   - **Opposed** — Understand concerns; neutralize or convert where possible.

---

## The RACI-Lite for Governance
For big initiatives, define:
- **R**esponsible — Does the work.
- **A**ccountable — Ultimately answerable.
- **C**onsulted — Input needed before decisions.
- **I**nformed — Updated on progress/decisions.

Keep it lean — governance bloats when too many are “consulted.”

---

## Regulatory & Compliance Mindset
- Treat compliance as **risk prevention**, not just a legal checklist.
- Integrate compliance into **product and ops design** instead of bolting it on.
- Build **relationships with regulators** early — don’t meet them for the first time in a crisis.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
Avoid:
- **Governance theater** — Meetings and decks that look like oversight but add no value.
- **Over-governance** — Slows execution and drives workarounds.
- **Under-engagement with stakeholders** — Creates political surprises.
- **Policy creep** — Rules multiplying without pruning.

---

## 90-Minute Governance & Stakeholder Workshop
1. **Governance audit (20m)** — List current decision rights, forums, and policies; remove or combine as needed.
2. **Stakeholder map (20m)** — Classify influence/alignment; plan engagements.
3. **Board readiness check (20m)** — Review last 3 board packets for clarity, brevity, and decision-focus.
4. **Compliance risk scan (20m)** — List top 5 regulatory/contractual risks; assign owners.
5. **Action plan (10m)** — Set 3 changes to governance that will improve speed + control.

---

## Stage & Context Adaptations
- Startup/Turnaround: Minimum governance; decision logs; investor updates focused on changes/asks.
- Scaleup: Formalize board packet TOC; quarterly review of decision rights.
- Enterprise: Lean governance refresh; prune policy creep; board committee alignment.
- Regulated: Compliance embedded in OS; regulator relationship calendar.
- Remote/Distributed: Async board materials; shared source of truth for decisions.

## Mini‑Case: Pre-wiring the Board
A CEO struggled with board pushback. By pre-wiring decisions with 1:1s and a crisp “changes-and-asks” cover letter, meetings flipped from debate to approval and strategic discussion.
