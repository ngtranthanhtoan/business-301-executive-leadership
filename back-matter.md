2. Choose an Advanced Mastery Track from the [References](executive_leadership_301_references.md) section based on your current challenges (e.g., Complex Systems for volatile environments).
3. Apply one new framework per quarter, tracking impact via your OS metrics.
4. Join or form a peer group of executives to discuss implementations.

## Acknowledgments and Usage
This book draws from decades of executive experience and proven frameworks. Special thanks to thought leaders like Richard Rumelt, Jeff Bezos, and Peter Drucker, whose ideas form the foundation.
