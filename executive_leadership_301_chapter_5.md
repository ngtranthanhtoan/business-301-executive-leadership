# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 5: Org Design & Talent Density

## Why This Chapter Matters
Most strategy failures aren’t *thinking* problems — they’re **org design** problems.  
If the wrong people are in the wrong structure, even the best strategy will crawl.

Your job:  
- Design the **minimum viable structure** that executes the strategy.  
- Maintain **high talent density** so every hire lifts the curve.

---

## First Principle: Structure Follows Strategy
- Don’t design for “org chart beauty” — design for **the work that must be done**.
- Ask:  
  1. What are the *critical capabilities* we must excel at?  
  2. What’s the smallest structure that delivers them?  
  3. How will decisions flow between these capabilities?

## Spans & Layers — The Goldilocks Zone
- **Span of control**: The number of direct reports a leader can effectively manage.  
  - Too wide → no coaching, shallow management.  
  - Too narrow → bureaucracy and slow decisions.
- **Layers**: Keep them as few as possible to avoid communication decay.

**Rule of thumb**:  
- Early stage: wide spans (7–10 DRs), few layers.  
- Growth stage: moderate spans (5–7 DRs), added layers only when complexity demands.

## Talent Density — Raising the Average
- **Talent density** = proportion of high performers in your org.
- High density means faster decisions, less politics, higher bar for everyone.
- Low density creates **managerial debt**: constant hand-holding, rework, missed targets.

**Maintaining density**:
- Hire slow, fire fast (for values/impact mismatch).
- Use performance data, not sentiment, to guide moves.
- Treat recruiting as a **core exec function**, not HR’s job alone.

## The 9-Box Talent Grid
A tool for plotting performance vs. potential:
- **Stars**: High performance, high potential — promote, stretch.
- **Workhorses**: High performance, low potential — keep in role, reward.
- **Question Marks**: Low performance, high potential — coach, decide quickly.
- **Laggards**: Low performance, low potential — exit quickly.

---

## Succession Planning as a Living Process
- Always have **ready-now** and **ready-soon** candidates for critical roles.
- Make it visible to the exec team — avoid “talent surprises” when someone leaves.
- Build internal talent pipelines alongside external recruiting.

---

## Common Org Design Patterns
- **Functional** — Good for specialization, weaker cross-functional alignment.
- **Divisional** — Good for product lines or geographies, risk of silos.
- **Matrix** — Combines both, but high complexity; only for mature orgs.
- **Pod/Squad** — Cross-functional mini-business units; agile but can duplicate effort.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Title inflation** — Creates fragile orgs when “leaders” aren’t actually leading.
- **Reshuffle addiction** — Changing the org chart instead of fixing execution.
- **Over-hiring leaders** — Too many chiefs, not enough operators.
- **Ignoring the B-players** — They define culture as much as A-players.

## 90-Minute Org & Talent Workshop
1. **Strategy alignment (20m)** — Identify the critical capabilities from your strategy.
2. **Org mapping (20m)** — Design structure to deliver those capabilities.
3. **Talent audit (20m)** — Plot your top 50 roles on the 9-box grid.
4. **Succession gaps (15m)** — Mark roles with no ready-now/soon replacements.
5. **Action plan (15m)** — Hiring, exits, role changes to close gaps.
