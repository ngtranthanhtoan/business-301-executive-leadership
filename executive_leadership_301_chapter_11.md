# Executive Leadership 301 — Chapter 11: Crisis Leadership

## Why This Chapter Matters
Crises are inevitable — outages, PR blow-ups, legal challenges, market shocks.  
How you lead in those moments defines **trust**, **reputation**, and sometimes **survival**.

---

## The Crisis Leadership Equation
```
Crisis Impact = Event Severity × Response Quality
```
You can’t always control severity, but you can radically change the outcome through **preparedness and execution**.

---

## The Four Crisis Phases
1. **Detection** — Spot the signal early.
2. **Stabilization** — Stop the bleeding.
3. **Resolution** — Fix the root cause.
4. **Recovery** — Rebuild trust, learn, and strengthen.

---

## The Command Tempo Model
- **High tempo** — Rapid cycles of assess → decide → act.
- **Clear decision-maker** — No ambiguity about who’s in charge.
- **Single source of truth** — One comms channel for updates.
- **Time-boxed actions** — Move in minutes/hours, not days.

---

## Roles in the Crisis Room
- **Incident Commander** — Owns decisions, sets tempo.
- **Ops Lead** — Coordinates internal teams/resources.
- **Comms Lead** — Manages internal and external messaging.
- **Legal/Risk Lead** — Tracks compliance and exposure.
- **Liaison** — Handles key stakeholders (board, customers, regulators).

---

## Crisis Communication Rules
- **Acknowledge fast** — Silence looks like incompetence or hiding.
- **Tell what you know and what you don’t** — Reduces speculation.
- **Commit to updates** — Set intervals (e.g., every 2 hours).
- **Align internal & external messages** — No surprises for your own team.

---

## The Pre-Mortem Technique
Run **pre-crisis drills**:
1. Imagine the worst plausible crisis.
2. Map the first 24 hours — actions, owners, comms.
3. Test systems and people against the scenario.
4. Refine the playbook.

---

## Recovery: Coming Back Stronger
- **Debrief** — Within 72 hours, capture lessons while fresh.
- **Fix permanently** — Address root causes, not symptoms.
- **Tell the recovery story** — Show stakeholders how the org improved.
- **Update playbooks** — Every crisis makes the next one easier.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Decision drift** — Too many voices, no clear owner.
- **Comms blackout** — Creates panic internally and externally.
- **Heroics over systems** — Burning out a few stars instead of using process.
- **Failing to learn** — Repeating the same mistakes in the next crisis.
